# CeaserCipher
Simple CeaserCipher Cryptography Demo using Python 3

* Main file to start is `CeaserCipher.py` .
* Words are validated for finding best fit shift key for decryption using `words.txt` file.


#### How To Use:
* User is asked to select one task either Encryption or Decryption.
* For Encryption, User is prompted for text and shift key to encrypt.
* For Decryption, user is prompted for text. Best shift key is caculated by system itself.
(NOTE: Use only one shift key for one text)
